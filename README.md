The biggest issue was where to place which code where as well as what names to use for each part. I had difficulty with the local storage portion. At first, I was targeting the wrong part of the form so everything disappeared on submit. Once that was fixed I could not get the saved data in local storage to show up on refresh, that was easier to fix once I knew what I was targeting. Lastly it does not work on Safari, not sure if it suppose to or not.
